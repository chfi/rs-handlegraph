Handlegraphs in Rust
==========================


A Rusty take on the
[`libhandlegraph`](https://github.com/vgteam/libhandlegraph)
interface for variation graph access and manipulation.


# Overview

This crate provides a number of traits that together encapsulate the
handlegraph interface. While these traits do not form a direct mirror
of the C++ interface, (almost) all of the features should exist and be
usable.
