//! Traits for immutable access to a HandleGraph, including its
//! nodes/handles, edges, and the sequences of nodes.
//!
//! With the exception of [`HandleGraph`] and [`HandleGraphRef`], each of
//! these traits are centered on providing iterators to one specific
//! part of a graph. For instance, [`IntoNeighbors`] gives access to
//! the neighbors of a handle, using the associated type `Neighbors:
//! Iterator<Item = Handle>`.
//!
//! Most of the methods that define the immutable part of the
//! handlegraph behavior have default implementations in terms of
//! these iterators, though it may be desirable to provide specific
//! implementations in some cases.
//!
//! The methods on the iterator traits often take `self`, rather than
//! `&self`, because the iterators are expected to borrow (part of)
//! the graph, which means the associated types in the concrete
//! implementations will include lifetimes, and at this time the only
//! way to do that is by using a lifetime that's part of the trait's
//! implementing type.
//!
//! For this reason, you won't actually implement [`IntoHandles`] for
//! [`PackedGraph`](`crate::packedgraph::PackedGraph`), but rather for
//! `&'a PackedGraph`.
//!
//! The [`HandleGraphRef`] trait is provided to make it more convenient
//! to write generic functions using any subset of the handlegraph
//! behaviors.
